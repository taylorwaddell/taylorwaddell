### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Taylor and I'm from the boot state of Louisiana. I spend most of my time hunched over a computer pumping out creative nectar. Sometimes this nectar in the form of JavaScript & HTML other times in the form of vectors & designs. I am always looking for an opportunity to merge my passion for the outdoors with my passion for coding and design!

When I am not creating on my computer, my time is typically spent outdoors, with family & friends, or traveling. Whatever it is I'm doing though, the goal is to learn more and fuel the fire of passion!

ðŸ”­ - Iâ€™m a UX Developer working at Veris Global!  
ðŸŒ± - Iâ€™m currently learning Senior Dev Soft Skills (udemy course), Framer Motion, and Next.js.
