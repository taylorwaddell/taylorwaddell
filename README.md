### Hi there 👋

My name is Taylor and I'm from the boot state of Louisiana. I spend most of my time hunched over a computer pumping out creative nectar. Sometimes this nectar in the form of JavaScript & HTML other times in the form of vectors & designs. I am always looking for an opportunity to merge my passion for the outdoors with my passion for coding and design!

When I am not creating on my computer, my time is typically spent outdoors, with family & friends, or traveling. Whatever it is I'm doing though, the goal is to learn more and fuel the fire of passion!

🔭 - I’m currently working on a React Shopify web app and a landing page for a local business.  
🌱 - I’m currently learning web secuirty theory, shopify, and personal finance.  
⚡ - Fun fact: I worked and trained as a raft guide through the NOC in western North Carolina and am currently working on my Life Coaching certficiation!
