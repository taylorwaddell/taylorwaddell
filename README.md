### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Taylor and I'm from the boot state of Louisiana. My days are dedicated to crafting digital art and code. I alternate between weaving intricate JavaScript and HTML, and creating vibrant vectors and designs. I'm constantly seeking ways to blend my love for nature with my passion for coding and design, hoping to find that perfect intersection of the great outdoors and the digital realm.

When I am not creating on my computer, my time is typically spent outdoors, with family & friends, or traveling. Whatever it is I'm doing though, the goal is to learn more and fuel the fire of passion!

ðŸŒ± - Iâ€™m currently learning Senior Dev Soft Skills (udemy course), Angular, and Next.js.
